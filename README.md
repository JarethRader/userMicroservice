# User Microservice Boilerplate

## Getting Started

You will need to add some environment variables in order for this microservice to work. Create .env.development, .env.production, and .env.test in src/env/, and follow the example file for populating the necessary environment variables.

## Docker

If you're using this in a project, you will probably have a docker-compose file somewhere. You will need to create a Dockerfile for this microservice, but then you can add mongodb and redis containers to be used with this microservice.
